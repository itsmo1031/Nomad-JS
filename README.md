This repository is my etude of Vanila JavaScript Class of Nomad Coders ([Link](https://academy.nomadcoders.co/courses/enrolled/435558)). Thanks to @nomadcoders @serranoarevalo ðŸ˜Š.

##Configuration

Purely made of vanila JavaScript. Column-style clock is from the Codepen example ([Link](https://codepen.io/nelsonr/pen/eInHA)).

That clock was made of CoffeeScript, so I converted as vanila Javascript.
