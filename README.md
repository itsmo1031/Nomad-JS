This repository is my etude of Vanila JavaScript Class of Nomad Coders ([Link](https://academy.nomadcoders.co/courses/enrolled/435558)). Thanks to @nomadcoders/serranoarevalo ðŸ˜Š.

## Configuration

Purely made of vanila JavaScript. Column-style clock is from Codepen example ([Link](https://codepen.io/nelsonr/pen/eInHA)).

Because that clock was made from CoffeeScript, I converted as vanila JavaScript.
